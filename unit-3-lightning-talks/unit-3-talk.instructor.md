# Instructor: Unit 3 Talk

Topics are listed in the order they should be presented.

Here is a [google sheet with the topics and a template for student sign-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBaM-hHg7qvknmU4TpQaLmlPBGR5SCEZ-cOU4gJe-NA/edit?usp=sharing)

This google sheet should not be edited directly. Make a copy of the spreadsheet, and rename the tabs with homeroom class names.

For classes with 28 or fewer students, these topics are combined:
* Describe continuous integration, continuous deployment, and Travis CI
* Explain Github Actions
