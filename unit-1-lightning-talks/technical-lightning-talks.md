# Technical Lightning Talks

## Goal

Your goal is to create and deliver a lightning talk presentation on a given topic! You will be teaching a topic that extends our knowledge! Your audience will be your other cohortmates.

## Requirements about the Presentation

Your presentation will be about one of the topics listed below. Follow classroom instructions to get your topic.

Requirements about your presentation:

- No more than 5 minutes (Presentations over 5 minutes will be gently cut off)
- Slides are required (even if it is one slide)
- Video and audio are allowed, but must fit within the time limit
- Props and costumes are allowed

In your presentation, please cover the following topics if they're relevant:

- Definition of the topic
- Examples
- Syntax
- When would we use this?

Finally, before you submit your presentation:

- Include your name and pronouns in the first slide
- Your presentation must be uploaded to the Internet so that instructors can view it
  - We recommend using Google Slides, and setting the sharing permissions to "Anyone on the internet with this link can view"
- Submit your presentation below

### Tips

- Make a few strong points
- Less is more!
- Assume that the audience can look up details in-depth at a later time
- Make it personal, fun, and weird
- Be yourself

For inspiration, here are some ways to frame your presentation:

- If I needed to convince my cohortmates that this is worth doing more research on, what would I say?
- If I wanted to learn about this enough that I could talk to another programmer about this for 10 minutes, what would I say?
- If I thought this was the only opportunity for me and my cohortmates to hear about this topic before I did more research, what would I want to know?

### Timing

Presentations will happen on a rolling basis, refer to your class schedule for these presentation dates.
