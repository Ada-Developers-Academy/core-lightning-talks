# Instructor: Unit 1 Talk

For the students, we hide the "schedule constraints" of each topic.

This is the detailed Unit 1 topic list with their schedule constraints:

## Topics are listed in priority order

Here is a [google sheet with the topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNstupQkGo3cfLkof23ZzajUS2-wVNEXJRMzU2WXXnQ/edit?usp=sharing)

For classes with 29 or 30 students, these topics can be combined:
- **Define Python named parameters vs. positional parameters**
- **Define Python default parameters (and the danger of mutables)**

For classes with 29 students, the above topics can be combined, and **Define Integration Tests** can be removed.
