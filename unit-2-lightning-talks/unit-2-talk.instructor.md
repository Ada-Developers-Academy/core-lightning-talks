# Instructor: Unit 2 Talk

Topics are listed in the order they should be presented. The topics from **Describe how to use views/templates in Flask** and onward must be presented after Flask is introduced.

Here is a [google sheet with the topics and a template for student sign-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tj064fnubhsAyaTRnMN_0vzRxQliA92TageXfS1nabA/edit?usp=sharing)

This google sheet should not be edited directly. Make a copy of the spreadsheet, and rename the tabs with homeroom class names.
