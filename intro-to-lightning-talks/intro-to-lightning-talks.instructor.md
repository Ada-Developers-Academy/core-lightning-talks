- [This student-facing document defines lightning talks](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2330/blocks/1084/content_files/intro-to-lightning-talks/intro-to-lightning-talks.md).
  - What to get out of it: it tells them that the goal is to practice researching "just enough" for five minutes.
- [This student-facing doc defines the first lightning talk assignment](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2330/blocks/1084/content_files/intro-to-lightning-talks/personal-introduction-talk.md).
  - What to get out of it: Tells them the topic and says the requirements: must have at least one slide, no more than 5 minutes.
- [This student-facing doc is how students SUBMIT lightning talks for completion](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2330/blocks/1084/content_files/intro-to-lightning-talks/personal-introduction-submission.md).
  - What to get out of it: It's a field for students to put a Google Slides link in.
- [This student-facing doc is the schedule for student presentations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nQ1JDaHOUsVuEDeJb7NDMloJojEYFwtkwwBbROG7cxQ/edit#gid=0).
  - What to get out of it: it's filled in, Priyanka randomly assigned students to time slots. I think we can keep an attitude of "if you don't like your assigned time, please deal, because, it's your assigned time and you can do it."

## Schedule for instructors:

### 3/8:

In Homeroom, from 2:30-3pm, one thing y'all should do is cover lightning talks. Guiding questions are in the calendar.
As part of this, y'all should give out the [student-facing schedule for presentations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nQ1JDaHOUsVuEDeJb7NDMloJojEYFwtkwwBbROG7cxQ/edit#gid=0) (and the other docs above)

### 3/11, 3/12, 3/16:

- Facilitate the lightning talks according to the schedule. We gave a lot of buffer time, so adjust as necessary.
- After each session, encourage students to post their talk on #lightning-talks in Slack

### 3/15:

- In the homeroom checkin at 1-1:30PM, y'all will introduce the Unit 1 topics.
- This student-facing doc describes the topics for Unit 1 Lightning Talks. [At that time, students should sign up for a topic on this sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yuIiAGk4ZEiNHeUo_sV9g4mLVZ1KsAZnNh4kbFnhVbk/edit#gid=494484304).
- **Students must sign up by 3/17** or they will be assigned a topic.
- Based on the topic they're signed up for, Priyanka will make a Lightning Talk schedule for each class ASAP. Some topics will be presented 3/23, 3/24. Some will be presented 4/6, 4/7.
- Instructors should send out that schedule ASAP after it's set.
- Similarly, students will submit the lightning talk via this student-facing submission doc.
- Similarly, instructors should encourage students to post it on #lightning-talks

## FAQ

> Can students present these with a recorded video?

Nope! The goal here is to practice talking about code live, with people watching, in a safe environment. It's to parallel the need to present code in front of a software team.

> Can students ask questions after each talk?

I actually haven't thought through this... I think there's opportunity for that :D I'm open to hear what others think

> Will there be an example talk?

I plan to record an example lightning talk on Keyword Arguments and attach it to the Learn docs.

> When will this be visible?

The plan is to keep the Unit 1 Lightning Talk content invisible until 3/15.

> What happens if a student is absent on their lightning talk day?

I don't really know the answer but I'd guess that they must present at the next Lightning Talk session. This keeps going until we need to make an LP/do something else.
