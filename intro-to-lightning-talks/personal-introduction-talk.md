# Personal Introduction Talk

## Goal

Your goal is to create and deliver a lightning talk to introduce yourself and share part of your story! Your audience will be your other cohortmates.

## Requirements about the Presentation

Your presentation will be about one of the topics listed below. Follow classroom instructions to get your topic.

Requirements about your presentation:

- No more than 5 minutes (Presentations over 5 minutes will be gently cut off)
- Slides are required (even if it is one slide)
- Video and audio are allowed, but must fit within the time limit
- Props and costumes are allowed

Before you submit your presentation:

- Include your name and pronouns in the first slide
- Your presentation must be uploaded to the Internet so that instructors can view it
  - We recommend using Google Slides, and setting the sharing permissions to "Anyone on the internet with this link can view"
- Submit your presentation below

### Tips

- Make a few strong points
- Less is more!
- Assume that the audience can look up details in-depth at a later time
- Make it personal, fun, and weird
- Be yourself

## Topics

Your presentation should focus on one of these two topics:

1. What brought you to Ada?
2. An interest you have and its intersection with technology or software
3. Whatever topic you want (We recommend #1 or #2 if you don't have a preference).

Here are some example topics for interests and its intersection with technology or software:

- How to use a spreadsheet like a pro
- The history of hair technology
- How I use technology with my family
- Weird facts about Microsoft Word's Clippy mascot
- How the industrial revolution relates to imperialism
- The story of the first time I used a computer
- How a farmer uses a smart phone
- 90's Internet
- How to type on the home row
- Using technology and traveling
- Getting closer to my pets with technology
- Technologists who've inspired me

Please use these examples to inspire your own topic!
